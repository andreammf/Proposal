# Proposal

What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Game in Love2D

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that shows infinite amount of cat pictures.")
A simple game that give you one point every time you click on the image

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Programmed in Lua, it will be a game with an score included that only give you points if you click the right image and if the user click outside the image he/she loses the game. Executed in Love2D. 

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Learn at list the basics of Lua and how different it is compared to C or python

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Integrate more features inside my project. I really want to learn how animate and modificate characters using Love2D 

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A game that have more feature and levels rather than only one level with a score. 

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
I need more resources of how does Lua works. I kind of understand how it is divided and the functions but I think it is not enough to make an intermediate-level game. I think I need to research more about commands and functions in Lua. I think I already understand how designing and RGB works in this language but It has been a little complicated to find a good tutorial in google

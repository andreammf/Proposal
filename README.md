# Proposal

What will (likely) be the title of your project?
A Chrome extension using JavaScript

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that shows infinite amount of cat pictures.")
A chrome extension that lets the user translate any word from english to spanish and viceversa and add words to it.

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
What I was thinking to implement in my project is a API from google translate that allow the user to translate any word from english to spanish or viceversa. Written in JavaScript. I was thiking in implementing like a function that suggest the user the word that he/she may be looking for and also give the user synonyms of the word he/she is looking in that language. Also, allow the user to add words that she/he would fit and store that into a data base I look forward to add more features in the interface like current weather information but just as a plus.

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Learning how to implement APIs in JavaScript and get a better sense of how JavaScript works. Iam pretty sure I will get the translator function no matter what.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The goal is to create a good translator that allows the user to find any word in both languages. I think I could create like a function that suggest the user or "predict" the word that the user is looking for


In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I hope I can implement all the functions written above and my chrome extension won't crash. I hope I could implement the weather function too. I hope also I could get the user to add their words into the translator too without overwriting anything else

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
I will need to research more about implement APIs in JavaScript and create like an autofill function in javascript. I also will need to research about how to create a database to allow the user to add words into the translator
